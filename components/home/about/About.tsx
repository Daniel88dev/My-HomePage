              Hey! I&apos;m Daniel, if you didnt got that yet, i am specializing
              in Full Stack web development. So both Frontend, and Backend
              isn&apos;t stranger for me. Focusing in development in React for
              Frontend, and node.js with express as Backend. But learning new
              frameworks, and tools isn&apos;t problem for me. Same as speaking
              fluently in English language beside my native Czech language.

              I currently work for Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Czech s.r.o.,
              where web development isn&apos;t my job description. Web
              development is more like my hobby for me.

              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
