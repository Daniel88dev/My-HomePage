              If you havenâ€™t figured it out yetâ€”I specialize in Full Stack Web
              Development. Both frontend and backend development are within my
              expertise. My primary focus is on React with Next.js, but I
              originally started with Node.js and Express for backend
              development. Learning new frameworks and tools comes naturally to
              me, just like speaking fluent English alongside my native Czech.

              Currently, I work at Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Czech s.r.o.,
              where web development wasnâ€™t originally my main focus. I started
              coding as a hobby in my free time, but over time, it became a
              passion. Now, Iâ€™m increasingly involved in web development, as I
              find it both fascinating and a valuable skill to improve workflows
              and efficiency.

              Outside of work, I love hiking and occasionally enjoy playing
              board games with friends.

              Iâ€™m open to new opportunities where I can merge my passion for
              coding with impactful projects. Iâ€™m also available for freelance
              web developmentâ€”so if you have a project in mind, letâ€™s connect!
